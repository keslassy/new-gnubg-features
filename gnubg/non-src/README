The files in this directory, with the exception of cglm.shar, will
be generated automatically on systems supporting the autobuild
process. You should therefore not edit any of them. If you need to
alter code in any of these files you should instead edit the
corresponding file that generates it.

If you have trouble building any of these files you may copy the file
causing problems from this directory to its intended location.

cglm.shar is an archive of the header files installed by cglm, a
graphics math library for use with OpenGL, available from
https://github.com/recp/cglm but provided by few if any GNU/Linux
distributions.  It is needed to build GNUbg with the 3D board display.
