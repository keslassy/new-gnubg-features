/***************************************************      Explanations:       *************************************
      The main function is GTKShowScoreMap.
            1. It builds the window, including the score map, gauge and radio buttons, by calling BuildTableContainer()
                    [which calls InitQuadrant() for each score (i.e. in each scoremap square=quadrant) to initialize
                    the drawing tools].
                    It also initializes variables.
            2. New: It calls CalcEquities(), which: 
                - initializes the match state in each quadrant, by filling
                    psm->aaQuadrantData[i][j].ci for each i,j
                - for each score i,j, also calls CalcQuadrantEquities() to find
                    the equity of each decision and therefore the best decision as well,
                    and uses it to set the text for the corresponding quadrant (the best decision is stored in
                    psm->aaQuadrantData[i][j].decisionString). This text is displayed in step 5 below.
                    In the move scoremap, FindMostFrequentMoves() finds the top-k most frequent distinct best moves
                    and assigns them distinct colors, as well as English descriptions (in the "alpha version" where
                    English description is allowed).
            4. It calls  UpdateScoreMapVisual(), which for each quadrant runs ColourQuadrant(), updating:
                    (a) The color of each quadrant (for cube scoremap: using FindColour1() or FindColour2(),
                    depending on the coloring scheme; and for move scoremap, using FindMoveColour()). For instance,
                    in the move scoremap, FindMoveColour() checks whether the current best move is equal to one of
                    the TOP_K most common moves, and updates the quadrant and border colors according to the associated
                    color (e.g., if it's red, it sets the border in strong red, and the quadrant in weak red, based
                    on the equity difference with the 2nd best move).
                    (b) The equity text
                    (c) The black border for the square with a similar score to the current one
                    (d) The hover text of each quadrant (in SetHoverText())
                    Next, UpdateScoreMapVisual() sets:
                    (e) the row/col score labels
                    Then, for the cube scoremap, it runs DrawGauge() which updates
                    (f) the gauge,
                    and also it adds labels to the gauge.
            5. Careful! Finally, at the end, ColourQuadrant() asks to redraw, which implicitly calls DrawQuadrant().
                    This function updates the decision text in each square.
                    It also adds the equity text if the corresponding option is set.
    Radio buttons:
     - Changing the eval ply launches the ScoreMapPlyToggled function that also calls the functions in steps 2-5 above.
     - Changing the colour-by (ND/D or T/P) launches the ColourByToggled function that only calls UpdateScoreMapVisual
         (no need for new equity values); 
     - and so on for the different radio buttons.
*/

/* 
01/2023: Isaac Keslassy: several ScoreMap improvements:
- new Settings>Options>ScoreMap panel where all default options can be configured
    -> set as a frame
    -> later moved to Settings>Analysis>ScoreMap
- added Analyse > "Scoremap (move decision)" to the existing cube-ScoreMap entry
- added ply display in hover of cube ScoreMap, and aligned displays
- addressed the issues that occur when stopping computation in the middle, and 
    changed the order in which the ScoreMap displays, by using expanding squares
- also changed the order in which operations are launched: instead of computing the 
    cube info at all scores in one batch at first, which means a longer time before the 
    progress-bar evaluations even start, thus troubling the user, now compute the info 
    for each score just before evaluating it
- also recomputing the cube info only on needed squares upon table scaling
- also not recomputing the money-play equity unless needed
- (added then canceled a smooth table scaling where we see the previous computation results
    and colors while increasing the table size; the additional time to redisplay the previous 
    computations is not worth it) 
- removed label-by and layout radio buttons; they will only be configured in the 
    default settings panel
- corrected "similar score" inaccuracy when scaling the table up
- solved several bugs, including wrongly freeing memory allocations
- checked that it works in both Windows 10 and Ubuntu 22

12/2022: Isaac Keslassy: a few changes including:
- new help button to obtain explanations
- new "scoreless" (unlimited) option of Money without Jacoby
- new cube equity display options: absolute, or relative ND-D, or relative D/P-D/T
- new tooltip hover text to explain each option
- added effective ply mention in hover text (because gnubg sometimes returns a 2-ply eval in a 3-ply mode if 
    the eval difference between the best and 2nd-best move is large)
- default smaller quadrant size to fit a smaller screen
- default analysis: 2-ply
- new way to decide the table size, i.e. the maximum match size to analyze, based on the current match size:
        1) for a small match of size <= 3 -> use a table of size 3
        2) for a big match of size >=7 -> use a table of size 7
        3) for a medium-sized match or for money play -> use a table of size 5
- slightly modified options layout order
- removed bugs (cube value radio button upon match size downscale, match play equity upon table redraw)

Many thanks to Pierre Zakia and Philippe Michel for their patience and helpful comments!

/* TBD - known issue:

The scoremap button of the 1st move of any game in an analyzed match doesn't work at first. The error message is:
"No game in progress (type `new game' to start one)."
However, if we click on another move (even w/o doing anything else) then come back, the scoremap of the 1st move then works.
Yet, if we change the game and come back: again, it doesn't work.

It looks like this is not a scoremap issue. For instance, the "show" button has the same issue: if we pick the 1st move
(or one of its alternatives) of any game and click "show", we get an "illegal move" error message; if we click elsewhere
and come back, it works again. It may be a movelist construction issue.

/*  This function colors the quadrants in the move scoremap.
It looks at the best move of each quadrant, and compares it with the top-k most frequent moves of the scoremap
(or less if there are less than k); it then colors the quadrant according to TOP_K_COLORS.
For example, if the best move is the 3rd most frequent move, it looks at TOP_K_COLORS[3].
In addition, the function applies directly a desired strong border color TOP_K_COLORS[3] for the quadrant.
For instance, if TOP_K_COLORS[3]==(deep) blue, the border will be colored in deep blue, while the quadrant will be colored in light
blue, where the blue intensity is proportional to the equity difference with the 2nd best move, i.e. the magnitude of the mistake.
Finally, the function also adds the decision classification that corresponds to the best move (and therefore to the
corresponding color).

        (A) The user picks a default match length index (fixed or variable) through scoreMapMatchLengthDefIdx
        in the Settings > Options
        (B) When we launch the ScoreMap, we look at this default, and set: "psm->matchLengthIndex = (int) scoreMapMatchLengthDefIdx;"
        (C) If the choice is "variable length", we choose the match length (=maximum match size to analyze)
        based on the length of the current real match:
        1) small match of size <= 3 -> use 3
        2) big match of size >=7 -> use 7
        3) medium-sized match or money play -> use 5
        (D) Now the user can also change the match length for this ScoreMap only, which will not affect the default
        match length. Since we only offer fixed lengths, if the user chose a variable default, we need to display
        the correct fixed length.
